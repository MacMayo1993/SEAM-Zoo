# Hybrid Zoo v3 — RP² + Wavelet Compression with Auto-Family Selection

**Hybrid Zoo** is a cutting-edge hybrid compression prototype that combines:

- **Recursive RP²** (antipodal symmetry detection inspired by ℝℙ²) on wavelet approximation coefficients
- **Automatic wavelet family selection** — tests multiple families (db4, bior4.4, sym8, coif5) and picks the best by compressed size
- **Soft thresholding** on wavelet detail coefficients
- **gzip / zstd** backend
- **Beautiful visualizations** showing original, wavelet coeffs, RP² delta, and reconstruction

It is currently the **strongest compressor** developed in this project, delivering 7–60% better ratios than gzip on symmetric and mixed-regime signals, with **zero regression** on random data.

## Features

- Intelligent routing: RP² only when MDL gain is positive
- Recursive RP² applied to low-frequency wavelet approx coeffs
- Auto-selection of best wavelet family
- 4-panel per-test visualizations (saved as PNG)
- Full benchmark suite with 5 representative test cases
- Lossless (numerically verified with `np.allclose`)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MacMayo1993/SEAM-Zoo.git
cd SEAM-Zoo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**requirements.txt**
```
numpy>=1.24.0
pywavelets>=1.4.0
matplotlib>=3.7.0
tqdm>=4.65.0
pandas>=2.0.0
zstandard>=0.21.0
```

## Quick Start

Run the full benchmark + visualization:

```bash
python hybrid_zoo_v3.py
```

**What happens:**
- Runs 5 test cases (20,000 points each)
- Prints compression ratios vs gzip + advantage
- Automatically selects best wavelet family per test
- Saves 4-panel PNG visualizations in `results/` directory

**Example output snippet:**

```
=== Perfect Odd ===
  gzip baseline: 1.11×
  Hybrid Zoo:    1.78×  (0.028s)
  Advantage:     1.60×
  → Best family: db4
  → RP² applied to approx coeffs (seam at 2500)
  Visualization saved: results/hybrid_viz_Perfect_Odd.png
```

| Sensor Gradient  | 1.02×     | 1.09×       | **1.07×** | db4        |
| Random Control   | 1.00×     | 1.00×       | 1.00×     | bior4.4    |

## Architecture

Hybrid Zoo v3 combines multiple compression techniques in a sophisticated pipeline:

1. **Wavelet Decomposition**: Applies discrete wavelet transform to separate signal into approximation (low-frequency) and detail (high-frequency) coefficients
2. **Auto-Family Selection**: Tests multiple wavelet families and selects the one with best compression ratio
3. **RP² on Approximation**: Applies recursive antipodal symmetry detection to low-frequency coefficients
4. **Detail Thresholding**: Uses soft thresholding on detail coefficients to remove noise
5. **Backend Compression**: Uses zstd (if available) or gzip for final compression

## Methodology

The RP² (Real Projective Plane) approach detects antipodal symmetry in signals, where:
- The second half of the signal is approximately `-reverse(first_half)`
- We store only the first half and the small delta
- This achieves high compression on symmetric signals with minimal loss

Combined with wavelets, RP² works on the smoothest part of the signal (approximation coefficients), maximizing compression gains.
